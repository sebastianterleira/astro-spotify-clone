This is a Spotify clone built with Astro, using the Spotify Web API for authentication and retrieving playlists related to the logged-in user. The View Transitions also don't lag behind, featuring fading transitions between pages, state persistence, and more.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Manual Installation

Here are the steps to execute the project:

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:sebastianterleira/astro-spotify-clone.git
   ```
   
2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Run the app

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environments

You need create a `.env` file to be able work with environment variable, you can see this file the example [(.env.example)](./.env.example)

## Authentication account for the app

I do this because Spotify has my application in 'developer mode,' and I have to enable the account for each user who wants to log in, with a limit of only 25 users. That's why I provide a sample Spotify account for them to use the app. However, if they want to log in with their own credentials, they should run the project locally, setting up a Spotify application to configure the environment variables.
